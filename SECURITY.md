# Security Features Documentation

## Overview
This NFT rental platform implements comprehensive security measures to protect users and prevent common vulnerabilities.

## Implemented Security Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Input Validation

#### Solana Address Validation
- **Location**: `src/lib/validation.ts`
- **Purpose**: Validates Solana mint addresses using proper base58 format checking
- **Features**:
  - Length validation (44 characters)
  - Base58 format verification
  - PublicKey constructor validation
  - Prevents malformed addresses from being processed

#### URL Security Validation
- **Purpose**: Prevents SSRF attacks and ensures secure image URLs
- **Features**:
  - HTTPS-only requirement
  - Private/localhost IP blocking
  - Malformed URL rejection
  - Protection against internal network access

#### Numeric Range Validation
- **Purpose**: Prevents overflow attacks and unrealistic values
- **Limits**:
  - Daily rent: 0.001 - 1000 SOL
  - Collateral: 0.001 - 10000 SOL
  - Duration: 1 - 365 days

### 2. Input Sanitization

#### XSS Prevention
- **Location**: `src/lib/validation.ts` - `sanitizeTextInput()`
- **Features**:
  - Script tag removal
  - JavaScript protocol blocking
  - Event handler stripping
  - Length limiting

#### Content Filtering
- Automatic sanitization of user-generated content
- Suspicious content logging
- Length-based attack detection

### 3. Rate Limiting

#### Client-Side Rate Limiting
- **Authentication**: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per email
- **NFT Listing**: 3 submissions per minute
- **NFT Rental**: 5 attempts per minute
- **Features**:
  - Per-user tracking
  - Configurable windows
  - Automatic cleanup

### 4. Security Monitoring

#### Real-Time Event Logging
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useSecurityMonitor.ts`
- **Event Types**:
  - Authentication failures
  - Validation errors
  - Rate limit violations
  - Suspicious input detection

#### Security Dashboard
- **Location**: `src/components/SecurityDashboard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time event monitoring
  - Event categorization
  - Severity classification
  - Metadata inspection

### 5. Authentication Security

#### Enhanced Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
- Password mismatch logging
- Weak password attempt tracking

#### Auth State Security
- Proper session management
- Email redirect URL validation
- Auth failure logging
- Rate-limited login attempts

### 6. Database Security (Previously Fixed)

#### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Secure access policies implemented
- Profile privacy protection
- Owner-only data access

#### Policy Details
- **Profiles**: Users can only view their own profile and renters of their NFTs
- **NFT Listings**: Owners can manage their listings, public can view active ones
- **Rentals**: Users can view/manage their rentals and listings

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple validation layers
- Client and server-side security
- Input sanitization and validation
- Rate limiting and monitoring

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- RLS policies restrict data access
- Users can only access their own data
- Minimal exposure of sensitive information

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging
- Real-time alerting
- Attack pattern detection
- Audit trail maintenance

## Deployment Security Recommendations

### Production Setup
1. **Enable Supabase Password Protection**
   - Navigate to: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
